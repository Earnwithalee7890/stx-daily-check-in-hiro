# UI Components

This directory contains the React components used in the Stacks Builder Challenge frontend.

## Key Components

### [SocialLinks.tsx](./SocialLinks.tsx)
Provides links to the developer's Farcaster, Twitter, and GitHub profiles.

### [ErrorBoundary.tsx](./ErrorBoundary.tsx)
Handles runtime errors gracefully to prevent the entire app from crashing.

## Styling
Components use the specialized CSS modules or global styles defined in the `styles` directory. Icons are mostly emoji-based or SVG-based for a lightweight and clean look.
